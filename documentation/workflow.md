# 1. Create a remote branch off of `main`

ðŸ’¡ Prerequisite:
Ensure that your task is already written on the Trello Board and is on status **TO DO**.

Example:

![Todo](./images/todo.png)

ðŸ’¡ Name the branch with the following **convention**: [type of task]/[name of task]

Examples:

- `docs/updating-readme`
- `feat/footer-section`

# 2. Writing code

1. Pass your task on the Trello Board to **DOING**

1. Write the necessary code and commit to the branch created on the first step.
2. Commit your code to the database following the best practices.

   ðŸ’¡ Check the following article to learn more about the best practices while commit your code to git.

   [How to Write Better Git Commit Messages - A Step-By-Step Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)

   ðŸ’¡ Git commits **must follow the** **convention**:
   `[type]:[description]`

   Examples:
   `fix: fix overflow on the navbar due the icon`
   `ci: implementing github actions pipeline to validate code`
   `feat: adding content section to the main page`

# 3. Create a pull request on GitHub

After performing all the necessary code to fulfill the functional requirements of the task open a pull request on the project, to merge from the branch where your work is present to the **Main** branch.

**Include the Trello task link in your PR description.**

ðŸ’¡ **VERY IMPORTANT:** Before making the pull request, merge the **MAIN** branch to the branch created on the first step to avoid merge conflicts, since it is very probable that someone pushed to the **MAIN** branch while you were developing on your separated branch.

   ðŸ’¡ Message to show that an pull request has comments to fix

4. Commit your fixes in the **SAME** branch where the Pull Request was created and inform of the fix.

5. After the PR is approved ( informed on teams chat ), you have the permission to finalize the PR and merge the branch to **MAIN**.

   ðŸ’¡ Example of message of Approval

   > "Approved" || "LGTM" xd

6. Merge the pull request

   ðŸ’¡ After the pull request is merged, ensure that your branch created remotely is **deleted.**

   ðŸ’¡ Inform the team that you made the merge request.

7. Pass the task on the Trello to **DONE**
